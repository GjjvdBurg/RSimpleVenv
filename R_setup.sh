# Setup an R environment in a given directory.
#
# This works as follows. We create an ".Rprofile" file in the current 
# directory that sets the .libPaths to the desired Rlib directory. We do the 
# same with an .Renviron file because it's R so one place isn't enough. This 
# essentially makes that the only source of packages read by anything that 
# respects this .Rprofile. Next we install packages as normal using the 
# install_if_not_exists.R script, which only installs packages if necessary 
# and supports GitHub and local packages as well.

# Here's a fun one: for some reason R tests lazy loading in vanilla mode by 
# default, which overwrites all the environment and library stuff we just 
# carefully set. This can break things when you have a different package 
# version installed in your user R package library. Luckily, if you dig 
# through the R source code (not in the documentation!), you can find out that 
# there's an obscure environment variable that can be set to disable this 
# behaviour. What fun! What an intuitively designed programming language! /s
